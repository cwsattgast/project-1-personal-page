Project 1 in Treehouse Teach Degree Program
I'm still getting the hang of Github. I didn't sync my project in the Github desktop app before submitting it for review. 
Now I realize that I have to do that step for it to be live in my Github repository. Hopefully I got it synced before instructor review!
